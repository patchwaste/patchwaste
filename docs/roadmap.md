# Roadmap

This roadmap is intentionally split into two tracks: Open Core (public) and Commercial (private buildout).

## Open Core (public)

### Now (v0.x)

- Improve Unreal/Steam parsing robustness
- Tighten baseline diff clarity and CI gating ergonomics
- Expand fixtures and regression tests
- Improve docs and error message quality

### Next

- Better contributor diagnostics in reports
- Safer defaults for strict mode and exit code behavior
- Install and packaging quality-of-life improvements

## Commercial Track (private)

### In discovery

- Centralized baseline/history service
- Org-level patch waste policies and approvals
- Dashboard for trend analysis and release sign-off

### Planned build sequence

1. Managed baseline/history API
2. Org policy engine and team roles
3. GitHub App / PR annotation service
4. Enterprise controls (SSO, audit, support SLA)

## Signals used to prioritize commercial acceleration

- Number of active repos repeatedly using open-core CLI
- Frequency of requests for shared policy/history workflows
- Trust level in open-core metrics for gatekeeping decisions
