# Distribution Plan: Where To Put Open Core + Where To Tell People

## Canonical home (open core)

- Host in a dedicated public GitHub repo/org: `patchwaste/patchwaste`
- Keep this repo as source of truth for:
  - code and releases
  - tutorial and FAQ
  - issue intake

## Primary launch channel
https://www.producthunt.com
1. Show HN (first)
   - Best early signal for devtools fit
   - Use `docs/launch/show-hn.md`

## Secondary channels (after Show HN)

2. Reddit (`r/gamedev`, `r/unrealengine`, `r/devops`)
3. LinkedIn (build/release engineering audience)
4. X for short updates and release drops
5. Direct outreach to 10 Unreal/Steam build engineers for high-signal feedback

## Channel order

- Day 0: GitHub release + Show HN
- Day 1: Reddit + LinkedIn
- Day 2-3: Direct outreach with canonical tutorial link

## Message consistency

Always include:
- who it is for (Unreal + Steam)
- what is available now (CLI/local analysis)
- what feedback is wanted (accuracy, clarity, CI friction)
- open-core boundary (hosted/team workflow is commercial track)
